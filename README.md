We created this link for our article to provide a "Data and Code Availability Statement". Our article is titled "Multi-level Accurate Prognosis Assessment of AIS Based on Ensemble Learning Method", which was coauthored by Yongjun Tao, Wei Ye, Xicheng Chen, et al.
Consistent with the manuscript, our code can be divided into two or seven categories based on differences in outcome variables. On the methodological side, our code contains rich diagrams of machine learning, deep learning, ensemble learning, and deep ensemble learning, and plots the corresponding ROC curves.
